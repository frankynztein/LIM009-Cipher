Using VanillaJS, HTML and CSS, ** AREA 51 CIPHER ** is a web app created to give you security each time you share information.
In the tech area, programmers need to be in constant communication, sharing information that is often confidential and an infallible feature in the system they choose to use is SAFETY.

** Area 51 Cipher ** offers a system of ** Caesar's Cipher Reloaded ** encryption system.

Maybe you know that Caesar's Cipher is one of the simplest techniques to encrypt a message. It is a type of cipher by substitution, that means that each letter of the original text is replaced by another one that is a fixed number of positions (offset) later in the same alphabet.

For example, if we use a 3-position encryption key:
- The letter * A * is encrypted as * D *.
- The word * CASA * ​​is encrypted as * FDVD *.
- Uncoded alphabet: * A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z *
- Cipher alphabet: * D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C *


* But why Reloaded? * - you may wonder.

In this system the letters do not always correspond to letters and the numbers do not always correspond to numbers.

For example: using an offset of 30, the letter * A * would be encrypted to * "_" *.

In addition, taking into account that code fragments are part of the information programmers share, special characters (* + '{} [] ... etc) have tech support. Nor is Latin American users ignored, so it also includes tech support for accented vowels and the letter "ñ".

Do you need to send the message quickly? Relax! WhatsApp comes to the rescue with a link.
And for the old school, email.

## Area 51 Cipher is super easy to use ;)


This is the welcome area. You just choose your language and you're ready to cipher!

If you want to encrypt an important message (* or you just don't want someone to understand it *), you will write or paste your message in the ** Encode your message ** section, enter the key (a number up to 100) and click on ** Encode **:

In case you want to decode a message, you'll do the same as you read before but ... * Yes, you guessed it! * In the ** Decode your message ** section, enter the key and click on ** Decode **:

The result of your encoded/decoded will be shown in the ** Your encoded / decoded message here ** area. You have the option to copy the message (_button ** Copy ** _) to take it wherever you want, plus, WhatsApp and email to send it. : wink:
